## Regression Project for ML

### Project Overview
  - This project explores regression analysis of various methods and compares their performance on a chosen dataset.
    It's goal is to research/analyse the data through multiple visuals and to understand how regression methods perform and
    to test various hyperparemeters in the ML models. This project showcases the proficiency in using Sci-kit Learn, Numpy,
    Pandas, Seasborn, and Matplotlib packages/libraries

### Methods
  - Multi Linear Regression (Statistial Values & Metrics)
  - Ridge Regression
  - Lasso Regression
  - Principal Component Analysis

###  Dataset
  - The data of laptop prices which included varibales such as brand, price, weight, dimension, etc.
  - Preprocessing involved normalization, feature selection, and encoding categorical variables

### Results
  - The results proved that Ridge and Lasso performed similarly while improving metrics over linear
    regression.
